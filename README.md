# Group My Stocks
A python software that can compare stock information by groups. The following APIs have been used: [yahoo_fin](http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/) and [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).

## Plans

1. Add more stock information and finincial data (currently here).
2. Add css for the html.
3. Update the html from static to dynamic.
4. Add database so users can save their own stock lists, positions, and view gain and lose, etc.
