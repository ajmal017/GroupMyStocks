# Group My Stocks
A python software that can compare stock information by groups. The following APIs has been used: [yahoo_fin](http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/) and [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).

## Plans

1. Add more stock information and finincial data (currently here).
2. Add css for html.
3. Update the html from static to dynamic.
4. Add database so the user can save his own stock lists, positions, gain and lose, etc.
