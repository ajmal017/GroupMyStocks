# Group My Stocks
A python software that user can compare stock information by groups. This software has used the following APIs: [yahoo_fin](http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/) and [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).

## Plans

1. Add more stock information (currently here).
2. Add css for html.
3. Update the html from static to dynamic.
4. Add database so the user can save his own stock informations.
